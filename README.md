# JQueryPromises
An example using JQuery promises

In this example we make use of http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com REST API.

The purpose of the example is to run a list of requests to build an object with the result of all of them.

First we get a list of data ids.
Late, we get every detail for each id.

During the example we simulate 4 ways to fetch all data.

We want to get the tasks, comments and personal information of all users of jsonplaceholder.
